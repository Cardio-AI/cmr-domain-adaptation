3D-MRI-Domain-Adoption
==============================

This repository includes the python helper function, model definition and trainings notebooks to trainn a tensorflow deep learning model, which transforms AX CMR images into the well known SAX domain.

Overview:
--------
Figure of the final pipeline
Use the Notebooks to interact with the python functions within the src directories.
